HTML Paint

Using HTML, CSS and JS, let's create an application that paints blocks into the viewport.

1. Create an event listener for a 'mousemove'
2. Create a new element using 'document.createElement()' and add to it:
    1. A class of 'block'
    2. A 'top' value that matches the position of the mouse Y
    3. A 'left' value that matches the position of the mouse X
3. Add the element to the '#artboard'

Ways to expand:

  1. Allow the user to cycle through a seleclt of colours by clicking the 'spacebar'
      - What would you need to achieve this? Perhaps an array? Think it through and solve.
